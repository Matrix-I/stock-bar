// swift-tools-version:6.0
//
// Package.swift exists ONLY to run unit tests — it does not build the app. Shipping builds stay with
// ./build_app.sh, which compiles every file under Sources/ as one module and links Sparkle; nothing here
// replaces or duplicates that. The two coexist because SwiftPM is inert until invoked: `swift test` reads
// this file, `./build_app.sh` never does. Both see the same files, so there is no second copy of anything
// and no list to keep in sync.
//
// The target is the whole of Sources/Core/, which is the tree's PURE layer and the reason this file can
// exist at all. The rule for that directory: Foundation only — no network, no UserDefaults, no AppKit or
// SwiftUI, no ObservableObject, and nothing that reads the wall clock without being handed it. Everything
// else under Sources/ is excluded on purpose: a source's output is whatever the exchange said at that
// second, so asserting on it would test the market, and the views need an NSApplication.
//
// Adding a pure helper therefore means putting the file in Sources/Core/ — nothing to edit here, and
// `swift test` picks it up. That is deliberate: an explicit file list would silently leave a new file
// untested the day someone forgot to add it. run_tests.sh greps this directory for forbidden imports so
// the rule is enforced rather than merely documented.
//
// Tests use swift-testing (`import Testing`), not XCTest: XCTest ships with full Xcode, while
// swift-testing ships with the Command Line Tools — the same and only requirement build_app.sh has.
