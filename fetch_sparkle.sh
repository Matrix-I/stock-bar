# fetch_sparkle.sh — downloads the pinned Sparkle release and vendors it into the repo:

# Both paths are .gitignored: the ~15 MB framework/tools are reproducibly re-fetched here instead of
# committed. build_app.sh calls this so a fresh checkout builds without any manual setup. Idempotent —
# it no-ops when the framework is already present, so normal rebuilds don't hit the network.
